# Natural-Language-Processing-with-Disaster-Tweets

## Topic and Goal

Twitter has become an important communication channel in times of emergency. The ubiquitousness of smartphones enables people to announce an emergency theyâ€™re observing in real-time. Because of this, more agencies are interested in programatically monitoring Twitter (i.e. disaster relief organizations and news agencies).

The task is to build a model that can classify tweets as either related to a real disaster or not. This is a common natural language processing (NLP) problem involving text classification.

I will use LSTM and GRU Model to do NLP classification in this project.
